                        Alexis was a girl at church that I was slightly annoyed with when I first saw her. She was the church pianist and I always dreamed of being the church pianist, so naturally I was jealous. My roommate Hunter told me that he had previously met her and that I should meet her because she was Filipino. We met and did what Filipinos always do when they meet each other for the first time: schedule a time to make Filipino food. We actually never got to making Filipino food, but I felt like I would enjoy going on a date with her. I asked her on the romantic spark igniter date of laser tag where she ditched me to go shoot some high school students on her own. That was our first date. Thinking that the date was a bust, I decided to think nothing of it and leave our relationship at that.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        My roommate urged me to take her on one more date and give her another chance. Little did I know, Alexis had gotten him a job a week earlier and he wanted to pay her back with a potential husband. We went on another date, and we enjoyed each other’s company until we started dating. Then, Alexis dropped the bomb… she was going on a mission. I asked her to stay, but she told me that she had to go because it was her dream. I knew that I couldn’t argue with that, so I dejectedly returned to my room that night not knowing what to do. As we kept dating, I saw mad wife potential. She could cook. She told corny jokes. She thought it was hot when I fixed my car heater when I accidentally just hit it really hard and it worked. So I decided to wait for her while she left on her mission.
                    </p>
                    <p class="indent">
                        Almost two years later, Alexis returned to me and we immediately knew that marriage was a possibility. We picked up where we left off very easily, and things were mostly the same, yet we had matured. I met her family; she met mine. Her family loved me; mine tolerated her. Just kidding… they liked her more than they like me. We thought about getting married about six weeks after getting back together, but I proposed almost five months later which leads us to now: engaged and waiting anxiously to be married on the 6th of July.
